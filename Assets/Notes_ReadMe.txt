Asteroids test task, try #2
Georgiy Padalko <georgiy.padalko@gmail.com>

Hi,
this is my second try to make this task.
First one was unsuccessfull, but after that my C++-test was ok, so I've decided to try Unity3D-test again
several weeks of intensive learning of the technology and best practices.

Unfortanutely I don't know what do reviewers dislike exactly in my previuous test, so this time I try to make the code
so simple, transparent and easy to understand as I can. Also the project does not contain any extra graphics, effects and so on.
I did it to make a review process simpler and faster. Also, each file contains small portions of notes where I explain
a purpose of a component or class.

I understand that different companies have different preferences and requierements, so I am ready to change the test to make it 
suitable for PlaySoft. Please let me know if you dislike any part of the project and I will change
it immediately to meet your requirements.
