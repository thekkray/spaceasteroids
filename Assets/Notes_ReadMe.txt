Asteroids test task, try #2
Georgiy Padalko <georgiy.padalko@gmail.com>

Hi,
this is my second try to make this task.
First one was unsuccessfull, but after that my C++-test was ok, so I've decided to try Unity3D-test again
several weeks of intensive learning of the technology and best practices.

Unfortanutely I don't know what do reviewers dislike exactly in my previuous test, so this time I try to make the code
so simple, transparent and easy to understand as I can. Also the project does not contain any extra graphics, effects and so on.
I did it to make a review process simpler and faster. Also, each file contains small portions of notes where I explain
a purpose of a component or class.

Feel free to contact me! I am ready to explain all choices I've made whild doing this test.
Direct links vs SendMessage, differect ways to implement object-pooling, public fields vs ScriptableObject, etc.

I understand that different companies have different preferences and requierements, so I am ready to change
the test to make it  suitable for PlaySoft. Please let me know if you dislike any part of the project and I
will change it to meet your requirements - I want to learn, to improve my skils, so I will be happy to hear
advices from Unity-masters.

Kind regards,
Georgiy.
